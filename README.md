**Slimbox One** is a **3D-printable mini-PC case** for Slimbook hardware.  
The design was created by our **friend and customer [@raurodse](https://github.com/raurodse)**, bringing a clean, functional look that matches Slimbook’s style.

## What’s in this repo
- `slimbox_one.3mf` – ready-to-slice project file.  
- `slimbox_one.stl` – export for generic slicers.  
- `slimbox_one.FCStd` – editable **FreeCAD** source.

## Features
- Compact, minimal aesthetic aligned with Slimbook design.  
- Layout optimized for desktop mini-PC builds.  
- Parts oriented for straightforward 3D printing and assembly.

## How to print
1. **Download or clone** this repository.  
2. Open the **`.3mf`** in your slicer (recommended) or import the **`.stl`**.  
3. Adjust print settings to your printer/material and **slice**.
